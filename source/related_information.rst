============================================== 
Information Related to Sites
==============================================

When a new site record is added, DEIMS automatically performs several tasks in the background.

Connections to other data repositories
============================================================
Using site identifiers (such as the DEIMS.iD or the ICOS station code), DEIMS checks external dataset catalogues for related content.

At present, DEIMS establishes such connections with:

- `The eLTER Digital Asset Register <https://dar.elter-ri.eu/>`_
- `The ICOS Data Portal <https://data.icos-cp.eu/portal/>`_

If related datasets are found, DEIMS automatically generates a preview on the corresponding site record. This process requires no user intervention.

Linking Existing Data Products
============================================================
As DEIMS is developed by eLTER, additional functionality is available for eLTER sites. This includes the creation of dedicated data products (e.g. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17036642) and their automatic linkage to site records.

For more information on these dedicated data products, please refer to the documentation provided under the respective DOI.
