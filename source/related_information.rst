============================================== 
Information related to sites
==============================================

Once a site record is added DEIMS is doing some things automatically.

Connections to other data repositories
============================================================
Using the site identifiers (e.g. DEIMS.iD or the ICOS station code) DEIMS checks external dataset catalogues for related content.

Currently, DEIMS does that for:

- `The eLTER Digital Asset Register <https://dar.elter-ri.eu/>`_
- `The ICOS Data Portal <https://data.icos-cp.eu/portal/>`_

If DEIMS finds datasets that are associated to a site record it will automatically render a preview of those datasets on the site record. This is done automatically and does not require user input.

Linking existing data products
============================================================
DEIMS is developed by eLTER and therefore allows extra functionality for eLTER sites. This includes the generation of data products (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17036642) and automatically linking the generated products to site records. If you have questions about the dedicated data products, please refer to their respective documentation under the provided DOI.
