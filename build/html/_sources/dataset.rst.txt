Adding or editing dataset information

Adding a dataset
============================================================
Go to "Edit/Add new content" and then select "Dataset"

In order to add any content, you have to log in.
When adding a dataset please bear in mind that you can reuse already defined observation locations.

Adding an observation location
============================================================
It is required to define the geographic information of a dataset. This is done by creating or referencing to an "observation location".


It is mandatory to give a research site:

- Name of Observation Location
- Textual Description and
- Geographic Location (the actualy boundaries of the area)

You can either create an observation location inline or go to the dedicated form ("Edit/Add new content" and then select "Observation Location")

Once an observation location is created it can be referenced by multiple datasets.
If you have multiple datasets that all share the same geographic extend you can create the observation location once and reference all datasets to this observation location.
This saves you time and your nerves :)

Please don't create multiple observation locations for the same geographic boundaries.
