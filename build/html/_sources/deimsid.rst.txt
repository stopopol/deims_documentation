What is a DEIMS.ID
============================================================
A DEIMS.ID is an identifier for your registered site.

It is:

- Unique
- Resolvable
- Persistent

The DEIMS.ID is issued only once for a site. It never changes and is designed to last for years. It is therefore suited to be used in papers, project reports or websites.

Getting a DEIMS.ID
============================================================
DEIMS.IDs are automatically generated for every site that is registered on DEIMS-SDR.

Finding your DEIMS.ID
============================================================
The DEIMS.ID is located right below the title of your site record.

Using your DEIMS.ID
============================================================
Be sure to reference your site by using the full DEIMS.ID,
